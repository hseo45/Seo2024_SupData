Supplemental data for paper "A timeline of biosynthetic gene cluster discovery in Aspergillus fumigatus: from characterization to future perspectives."

The following is a guide to the repo:

**BUSCOTrees** --> contains the output log file, and treefiles for all 700 single copy BUSCOs that were used in the construction of the species complex tree

**InputBGCs** --> contains all of the raw antismash predictions from the 264 *Aspergillus fumigatus* genomes

- FumiSpeciesComplex.tre is the ASTRAL produced species tree
- FumiSpeciesComplex_2-20-2024.log is the log file produced during the run of ASTRAL (see paper's methods)
